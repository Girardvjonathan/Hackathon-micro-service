# Hackathon-micro-service
// Fictional Intro

Following the major event in the tech world (the mega virus deleting most of the code source
of online shopping site and the quantum supremacy rendering traditional security obselete)
there is an opportunity to conquer the world of online shop while all the other company
are down.

So we will need to move fast by taking the space left for us by creating an awesome application
in a day. This application will let user create their own personal online store.

You will need to use micro-service to allowed the system to scale (and to please
the boss who now think he is a architect expert after watching one tech talk).

The application will be separated in theses services:
* Users services
* Stores services
* FrontEnd dispatcher
* Items services
* Monitoring services

You can find information on the requirements inside issues in this repo.

Keep in mind that we only have one day and that the current state of security is
bad everywhere so we can cut corner (for now).

Also if you have time, the boss nefew just heard of Continuous delivery and would
like you to implement one pipeline. He kinda blackmailed you to do this or he would
snitch to your coworker where is your secret oreo stash :o
So your call :p

Good luck and may the force be with you!
